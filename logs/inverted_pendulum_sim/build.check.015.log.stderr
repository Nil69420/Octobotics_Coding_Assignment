  By not providing "Findpygame.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "pygame", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pygame" with any
  of the following names:

    pygameConfig.cmake
    pygame-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pygame" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pygame_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "pygame"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
